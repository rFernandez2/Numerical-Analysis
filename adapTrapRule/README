In order to make the plots I used GNUplot and thus the inclusion of gnuplot_i.hpp.

In order to run you must simply run:

g++ ./main.cpp
./a.out

and the program will print out all estimated integrals. Plots were done with another script and thus I included the code in the C++ file but commented it out.

Each plot is labels (plots 1-3 are function 1 plots A-C etc.) and plots 13-16 are the alternate (4*fine - coarse) / 3 plot B. We can see that for all of these we have that actual error=0 and this is because of, as we went over in class, the 4/3*fine - coarse/3 has coefficients summing to 1 and the errors give us the actual value.

I also had issues with making the third plot for each function so I printed out the data and redirected it to a data file (those inside the Data folder) and then made the corresponding plots on gnuplot with that data.

Sorry for the messy plots and lack of automatic creating with C++, I am just only this week starting to learn C++ and had trouble with the output to different files. Will definitely be fixed by the second project.
