In order to run program:

g++ ./main.cpp
./a.out
open ./plots.eps

The approximate values will be printed to the terminal and the plots will all be in the eps file.

It is interesting to note that the functions approximated exactly right are those where i,j <= 1 while all the other functions that were of the non-linear nature required more rectangles as the function's derivative increased in order to properly approximate it.
